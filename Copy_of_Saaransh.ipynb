said.Meteorologists warned that the Ile-de-France region, which includes the capital Paris, could have violent wind gusts.The SNCF rail network said it would halt service on several of its suburban commuter lines around the capital, including the popular RER A train that serves western suburbs.Two French regions will also be placed on maximum flood alert, it added.Vast stretches along the French coast, from the Gironde region to the northern Hauts de France, will be on the lower category orange alert.In Pas-de-Calais, authorities said they would open two gymnasiums and several shelters for migrants who converge on the region, hoping to make it to Britain by boat.In Britain, the meteorological office said there would be bursts of heavy rain, a risk of flooding in some areas and gusts of 60-70 miles per hour along England's south coast.In France, the storm was even expected to unleash winds of up to 170 kilometers (106 miles) per hour, notably on the coastlines of Brittany and Normandy in the northwest, Meteo-France forecaster Francois Gourand warned on Tuesday.Rainfall could reach 50 millimeters within just six hours in those areas, the weather agency said.Ciaran is expected to hit Brittany before midnight Wednesday, with winds of up to 150 kmph on the coast, and 130 kmph inland with a second, more violent, storm phase following some hours later.Rail services cancelledSome 3,200 firefighters will be deployed in the most exposed areas, the French interior ministry said.Map showing forecast wind gusts between November 1 (1900 GMT) and November 2 (1700 GMT),

also banned all truck traffic in Brittany for Thursday.National rail operator SNCF has stopped regional trains in the most affected areas, and cancelled a number of high-speed TGV rail services.Eurostar, expecting disruptions and slowdowns, told AFP it was recommending that passengers delay any trips planned for Thursday.The Brittany airports of Brest and Quimper were ordered closed, and most ferry traffic to Breton islands is to be stopped.Coastal flooding is likely from early Thursday, Olivier Caumont, also at Meteo-France, told reporters, with waves possibly rising up to 10 meters (33 feet).Maritime authorities issued a strong warning against taking boats out to sea, or even approaching the coast \\\"be it by car or on foot\\\".'Lie low, fingers crossed'They also said a powerful tugboat would be deployed to help any vessels in distress.\\\"All we can do is to lie low and keep our fingers crossed,\\\" said Olivier Laban, president of the shellfish farming committee in the Arcachon basin in France's southwest.In Britain Kate Marks, flood duty manager at the Environment Agency, said \\\"significant flooding\\\" was possible, warning people to stay away

traffic jams.Several schools said they would be closed or partially closed Thursday.Ciaran's impact could be felt as far south as Spain, where wind speeds of up to 90 kph were expected for Thursday.Authorities asked people to take down tarpaulins, avoid walking under trees and removing flower pots from balconies.While storms are a naturally recurring phenomenon, they can be made worse

Ciaran is expected to hit Brittany before midnight Wednesday, with winds of up to 150 kmph on the coast, and 130 kmph inland with a second, more violent, storm phase following some hours later.Rail services cancelledSome 3,200 firefighters will be deployed in the most exposed areas, the French interior ministry said.Map showing forecast wind gusts between November 1 (1900 GMT) and November 2 (1700 GMT), in western France, placed on high alert due to Storm Ciaran.The authorities, warning of falling trees and blocked roads, have urged people to remain indoors and stay away from the coast.The government also banned all truck traffic in Brittany for Thursday.National rail operator SNCF has stopped regional trains in the most affected areas, and cancelled a number of high-speed TGV rail services.Eurostar, expecting disruptions and slowdowns, told AFP it was recommending that passengers delay any trips planned for Thursday.The Brittany airports of Brest and Quimper were ordered closed, and most ferry traffic to Breton islands is to be stopped.Coastal flooding is likely from early Thursday, Olivier Caumont, also at Meteo-France, told reporters, with waves possibly rising up to 10 meters (33 feet).Maritime authorities issued a strong warning against taking boats out to sea, or even approaching the coast \\\"be it by car or on foot\\\".'Lie low, fingers crossed'They also said a powerful tugboat would be deployed to help any vessels in distress.\\\"All we can do is to lie low and keep our fingers crossed,\\\" said Olivier Laban, president of the shellfish farming committee in the Arcachon basin in France's southwest.In Britain Kate Marks, flood duty manager at the Environment Agency, said \\\"significant flooding\\\" was possible, warning people to stay away from swollen rivers and motorists not to drive through flood water.Storm Ciaran comes less than two weeks after Storm Babet claimed five lives in the UK in heavy flooding and high winds.\\\"Some parts of south Wales and southwest England may see 80 mm (more than three inches) of rain,\\\" said Met Office deputy chief meteorologist Dan Suri.Officials said coastal flooding is likely from early Thursday.Flooding due to heavy rain has already seen some 12,000 sandbags deployed in the east of Northern Ireland.The Channel Islands, off the coast of northern France, have also been warned to prepare for flooding.As far as SpainIn Belgium, the weather office issued an orange alert for the Flemish coast, a yellow alert for the rest of the country, and urged \\\"great caution\\\".The cities of Brussels, Antwerp and Liege announced that parks would be closed.The Flemish provinces of West Flanders and East Flanders both said they would close access to outdoor sports facilities, and ban people from entering forests or natural reserves.In neighboring Netherlands, the weather service issued a code yellow alert for Thursday, while motorists were advised to work from home to avoid traffic jams.Several schools said they would be closed or partially closed Thursday.Ciaran's impact could be felt as far south as Spain, where wind speeds of up to 90 kph were expected for Thursday.Authorities asked people to take down tarpaulins, avoid walking under trees and removing flower pots from balconies.While storms are a naturally recurring phenomenon, they can be made worse by climate change, according to scientists.Flooding is likely to be exacerbated by rising ocean levels as a result of melting glaciers.\\u00a9 2023 AFPCitation:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tStorm Ciaran triggers weather alert in northwestern Europe (2023, November 1)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tretrieved 3 November 2023\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom https://phys.org/news/2023-11-storm-ciaran-triggers-weather-northwestern.htmlThis document is subject to copyright.

One of the proposed routes is nearly half a kilometre (over a quarter of a mile) long. Looking exhausted and anxious, with thick beards, the men could be seen peering at the endoscopic camera sent by rescuers down the thin pipe through which air, food and water are being sent. \\\"We will bring you out safely, do not worry,\\\" rescuers can be heard telling the helmet-wearing men trapped inside as they gather near the camera, video released by state authorities shows. Excavators have been removing tonnes of earth, concrete and rubble from the under-construction tunnel in the northern Himalayan state of Uttarakhand since November 12, after a portion of the tunnel collapsed. But rescue efforts have been slow, complicated by falling debris as well as repeated breakdowns of crucial heavy drilling machines, with the air force having to twice airlift in new kit. Before the camera was introduced, rescuers had been communicating with the men inside using radios. \\\"All the workers are completely safe\\\", Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said in a statement. \\\"We are trying with all our might to get them out safely soon.\\\" Dhami said he had spoken to Prime Minister Narendra Modi about the men, adding Modi told him it had to be their \\\"top priority\\\" to get the workers out. Engineers had been trying to horizontally drive a steel pipe just wide enough for the increasingly desperate men through at least 57 metres (187 feet) of earth and rock that block their escape. But the giant earth-boring machine they were using ran into boulders it could not get through. Drilling on that route was paused on Friday after a cracking sound created a \\\"panic situation\\\", officials said. Rescue teams are now preparing two new approaches to reach the men. One is drilling a vertical shaft down from the forested hill above, forcing workers to cut an entirely new track to the top for the heavy equipment needed. Officials estimated the proposed vertical shaft would need to be 89 metres (291 feet) deep, a potentially complex dig above the men in an area that has already suffered a collapse. The other is to approach from the far side of the road tunnel, a far longer route of more than 450 metres, according to Indian media reports. The tube used to deliver supplies to the men was successfully widened on Monday with the installation of a 15-centimetre (six-inch) pipe, through which the camera was sent down. It is hoped that a drone can also be sent down to assess the stability of the area where the men are trapped. Hot meals were also delivered through the new pipe for the first time. \\\"We have sent 24 bottles with meals and bananas to the trapped workers,\\\" top local civil servant Abhishek Ruhela told AFP. Experts have warned about the impact of extensive construction in Uttarakhand, where large parts of the state are prone to landslides. The planned 4.5-kilometre tunnel is part of Modi's infrastructure plans aimed at cutting travel times between some of the most popular Hindu sites in the country, as well as improving access to strategic areas bordering rival China. Foreign experts have been drafted in, including Australian independent disaster investigator Arnold Dix, president of the International Tunnelling and Underground Space Association. \\\"Those 41 men are coming home,\\\" Dix told the Press Trust of India news agency. \\\"Exactly when? Not sure.\\\"\",\n          \"Hosts India play 2019 finalists New Zealand in a battle of the Cricket World Cup\\u2019s unbeaten table-toppers in Dharamsala.

As television cameras pan out behindthe stadium, the Himalayan mountaintops are noticeable in their pristine white glory. Temperatures are set to rise on Sunday, though, when the only two unbeaten teams at theCricket World Cupmeet. New Zealand andhosts Indiaare 4-0 in the tournament, although the 2019 runners-up New Zealanders lead on net run rate. New Zealand began its tournament by beating defending champions England by nine wickets, and then made easy work of the Netherlands (by 99 runs), Bangladesh (by eight wickets) and Afghanistan (by 149 runs). The tougher part of their league campaign begins on Sunday, againsttwo-time championsIndia, followed by Australia, South Africa, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. \\u201cIndia will be a massive challenge in its home conditions. At the moment, they are looking pretty tough to beat,\\u201d New Zealand left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner said after the win against Afghanistan.  Indeed, India have been steamrolling its opponents. They beat Australia by six wickets, brushed aside Afghanistan by eight wickets, beatarchrivals Pakistanby seven wickets and defeated Bangladesh by seven wickets. Fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah has led the wicket-taking for India, with 10 wickets in four games at an average of 13.40, and has been particularly effective in the middle overs. \\u201cPicking up wickets in the middle overs helps us control the run rates.

But India\\u2019s worry will be balancing out the bowling attack, as none of the top-order batsmen can reliably bowl. Whether picking bowling all-rounder Shardul Thakur or pacer Mohammed Shami, India will only have five bowlers to choose from. It is likely to be inclined towards Shami to have the best chance to bowl 50 overs against an in-form New Zealand batting lineup. The Black Caps continue to be without skipper Kane Williamson, who is currently out injured after fracturing his thumb, and Tom Latham will once again be in charge. The two countries have played 116 one-day internationals. India holds the better record, with 58 wins. New Zealand have won 50 of those games, while seven ended in no-result and one in a tie.

              "The giant oaks are turning copper; the hawthorns are burnished-marigold and most of the chestnut trees are vibrant with amber hues. Autumn might have arrived late this year in Windsor Great Park, but it’s turned up in majestic style. As the leaves crunch underfoot and float down from crooked branches above, their golden, sunset colours add a fleeting spectacle to this ancient landscape. Nature is all around the hotel. Tapping into Mother Nature’s playground, Fairmont Windsor Park is found in prime position – alongside the royal park itself. At this time of year, crisp autumnal walks take you through the hotel’s 40 acres of gardens, and into Windsor Great Park’s 4,800 acres of forests, grasslands and meadows. Immaculate grounds are part of the attraction. To arrive at the hotel by car, you cross a scenic bridge and past a lake that is elegant with spurting fountains. On the front lawn, brass sculptures of galloping horses give a nod to the history of the land and they also act as a precursor to the riff on nature that runs throughout the hotel’s design concept. Grand in style, the lobby sets the tone for the hotel’s lavish aesthetic with its triple-height glass atrium, black polished floor and marble tables housing lofty floral arrangements. British heritage is something that is continuously referenced at Fairmont Windsor Park, with an old fashioned sweet shop and a Floris London store, the renowned British family perfumery since 1730, both found in the entrance to the hotel. (In the spa, there’s also an outpost of Truefitt & Hill, recognised as the world’s oldest traditional gentlemen’s barber in London, operating since 1805.) The modern asethetic give a polished finish. Once a Jacobean mansion stood on this site, but these days there is no sign of the creaking beams that once held that property steady. Instead, you’ll find cascading, waterfall chandeliers, grand symmetrical corridors and gleaming marble surfaces to give an air of sparkling 21st century sophistication. You might well be dazzled by the tasteful opulence, but there are also plenty of thoughtful touches to be found, too – from the sweet, watercolour art works that line the corridors, depicting birdlife, plants and flowers, to the delicate blossom print wallpaper in the bedrooms, which is also stretched across the ceiling, giving a stylish flourish to each space. Nature is reference throughout the interiors. In the bathrooms, meanwhile, natural stone vanity units, egg-shaped tubs and Le Labo toiletries combine to give a feeling of refined luxury. Subtlety is key to the finesse of the interior design – deep carpets have faint flora imprinted in it, linens are crisp and armchairs are covered in fine taupe linen. It’s all done in the best possible taste. British heritage is referenced in the Library Club.  As the days get darker and the festive season approaches, Fairmont Windsor Park comes into its own. The perfect winter retreat, you can spend hours in the cosy lounges with their roaring fires and in the wide variety of bars and restaurants – from the Library Club whisky lounge to the pretty Orchid Tea Room. Kicking off on the 18 December, festive experiences for the little ones will include scavenger hunts, gingerbread house crafting, movie nights and pony riding. Children will also be able send their letters to Santa via the official reception postbox, each one personally answered by one of Santa’s elves. Take a deep dive into wellness at the spa. For adults, the state-of-the-art spa is, no doubt, one of the property’s highlights, especially in the winter time. When the hotel opened in early 2022, built to the tune of £200 million, hotelier and owner Surinder Arora wanted a spa that replicated those found in the Middle East and it does not disappoint. The sprawling wellness facility is a destination in itself, with 18 treatment rooms, a six-person hammam, a cryotherapy chamber and an Himalayan salt room. As well as a 20m indoor pool, there is also a courtyard hydrotherapy pool and a bulging treatment book of signature treatments by leading luxury brands, such as Comfort Zone, Mauli Rituals and Davines, for hair care. Perfectly suited to the season of celebration is the Sultane de Saba Liquid Gold Facial. The treatment includes a deep cleanse, a gold, radiance-enhancing mask and a head massage. You may not find frankincense and myrr, but you will discover gold in the form of the mask and the brand’s Argan oil, enriched with 23 carat gold, as well as caviar and pearl, which works to restore firmness and luminosity – just the thing to leave you glowing for the party season. Christmas is celebrated in magical style. For guests wanting to decamp over the Christmas period, the hotel promises a sprinkling of magic with many experiences taking place in the hotel’s fine dining restaurant, 1215. Named after the year in which the Magna Carta was signed, in nearby Runnymede, the restaurant’s classic British menu continues this connection to heritage, with dishes honouring locally grown produce from the Royal Farms, Windsor artisans and the hotel’s vegetable and herb gardens – whether it is the warm salad of roasted artichoke, black garlic and radish or the Suffolk lamb loin, with merguez sausage, broccoli and garden kale. For the festive period, culinary highlights include a Christmas Eve Tasting Menu at 1215, and a sumptuous Christmas Day morning breakfast buffet at MOREISH – the hotel’s more casual restaurant that focuses on Mediterranean and Middle-Eastern cuisine. Expect homemade Christmas pudding, live musical performances, a special appearance by Santa Claus and a Christmas carol karaoke. Local produce and seasonal ingredients are at the heart of the gala dinners. For those wanting to ring in the New Year in style, there’s an intimate five-course tasting menu in 1215, or a family-friendly five course meal in MOREISH. The pinnacle of the festivities is the Black-Tie Gala Dinner, set in the Arora Ballroom for guests to dance the night away. A new year beckons – it’s a golden opportunity not to be missed.

              "AFP US electric carmaker  Tesla  is willing to invest up to $2 billion for setting up a local  factory  if the government approves a concessional duty of 15% on imported vehicles during its first two years of operations in India. According to sources aware of the matter, Tesla has approached the union government with a detailed proposal linking the quantum of  investment  to the number of cars it can import at lower duty. The company is willing to invest up to $500 million if the government extends  concessional tariff  for 12,000 vehicles and can increase this up to $2 billion if the reduced duty is approved for 30,000 vehicles. People close to the development said the government is examining the viability of the upper range of Tesla's proposal - the investment of $2 billion to set up a plant.   Bank guarantee EV calculator How much will I save if I choose an electric vehicle? SELECT vehicle type Calculate   The government also wants to reduce the number of cars that can be imported at a concessional tariff, compared to the numbers proposed by the American carmaker. It is evaluating if concessional tariffs should be restricted to 10% of the total EVs projected to be sold in India in the current fiscal year (10,000 units) and it can be increased by 20% for the second year. Around 50,000 EVs were sold in FY23 and this is expected to go up to 100,000 in FY24. Tesla may commit to localise up to 20% of the value of made-in-India cars in 2 years and increase that to 40% in 4 years. The proposal is being jointly evaluated by the department for promotion of industry and internal trade (DPIIT), ministry of heavy industries (MHI), ministry of road transport & highways (MoRTH) and the  ministry of finance  under the guidance of Prime Minister's Office (PMO). Emails sent by ET to Tesla and the ministry of commerce & industry seeking comments remained unanswered at the time of going to press Thursday. India imposes 100%  import duty  on cars with cost, insurance, and freight value of more than $40,000, and 70% on vehicles cheaper than that. Further, the government may require a bank guarantee linked to the capital commitment to recoup loss on account of import duty if the US carmaker does not deploy funds as committed. The Austin, Texas-based company is requesting the government not to insist on a bank guarantee, the sources cited said. Tesla is planning to commence India operations with three vehicles - the Model 3,  Model Y  and a new hatchback, priced at $39,000 (Rs 32.37 lakh), $44,000 (Rs 36.52 lakh) and $25,000 (Rs 20.75 lakh), respectively, in the US. According to a person in the know, the Model 3 and Model Y are likely to be priced at Rs 38 lakh and Rs 43 lakh in India if concessional import duty is granted. A possible investment of $2 billion by Tesla was reported by Bloomberg on November 21. Details of Tesla's proposal as well as the government's thinking on the matter have not been previously reported. Senior government officials said an initial round of discussion took place with executives from Tesla recently. \"Wherever Tesla sets up a base, it does so with its entire supplier base. So, the investments are significant. They already source from some component makers here,\" said a person aware of developments. The sources cited said that discussions were ongoing, and details could change. Tesla is looking to source $1.7-1.9 billion worth of auto parts from India this year, up from $1 billion in FY23, minister for commerce & industry Piyush Goyal said recently during his trip to Tesla's factory in the US. Separately, the central government has said any incentive extended to facilitate local production of  electric vehicles  will be the same for foreign and domestic players, amid concerns raised by automakers in India over possible concessions in import duty to the American carmaker. New Delhi said it is not in favour of any company-specific exemptions. \"The government's approach is for the industry as a whole and not for any specific company because we have very strong domestic companies in this sector,\" said an official, adding that any incentives offered will be equal for domestic and foreign investors.

              "At least 157 people have been killed in a devastating earthquake in the remote Jajarkot area of the Himalayan country. The search and rescue efforts have been called off in Nepal, 36 hours after a disastrous earthquake killed at least 157 people and destroyed houses in the remote northwest region. Officials have shifted their focus to providing relief, food and shelter for survivors. At least 105 people were confirmed dead in Jajarkot district, a mostly agricultural area, while 52 people were killed in the neighbouring Rukum district, officials said. Another 184 were injured. At the regional hospital in the city of Nepalgunj, more than 100 beds were made available and teams of doctors stood by to help the injured. Many survivors spent the night under the open sky, their mud houses reduced to piles of rubble when the magnitude 5.6 earthquake hit late on Friday night, at 11:47pm (18:02 GMT) in the northwestern region with a population of about 190,000 people. Several people died in the village of Nalgad, in the worst-hit Jajarkot district, where Mahesh Chanare prepared to cremate his father-in-law on Sunday. “The rest of my family is safe,” the 34-year-old plumber said. “But the houses have buried everything with them, there is hardly anything to eat,” he added. “No relief materials have reached us. People here desperately need food and tents.” Provincial police spokesperson Gopal Chandra Bhattarai said that officials are in contact with all the affected areas and have completed rescue operations. “But we are still on alert as this is a remote area and there might be some isolated areas from where information has not flowed,” he said. Harish Chandra Sharma, a Jajarkot district official, said the focus was now on providing relief to the victims. “It has been a tough night and we are trying to get relief materials to those affected by the quake,” Sharma said. “Some have been distributed but we need to reach all areas.” On Friday, locals frantically dug through rubble in the dark to pull survivors from the wreckage of collapsed homes and buildings, as others crouched outside for safety. Security forces were deployed on foot and helicopters and small government planes that were able to maneuver the mountainous region were also pressed into action to assist with search and rescue operations and ferry the wounded to hospitals. In some affected areas, rescue and search teams cleared landslides caused by the earthquake in order to open road access,Bhattarai said. The tremors were felt as far away as the capital Kathmandu about 400km (250 miles) and even about 600km (375 miles) away in the Indian capital New Delhi. Nepal lies on amajor geological fault linewhere the Indian tectonic plate pushes up into the Eurasian plate, forming the Himalayas, and earthquakes are a regular occurrence. In 2015, about 9,000 people were killed intwo earthquakes in Nepal. Whole towns, centuries-old temples and other historic sites were reduced to rubble, with more than a million houses destroyed.

              "ABOARD THE ALLANKAY off Antarctica --The Antarctic Endeavour glides across the water’s silky surface as dozens of fin whales spray rainbows from their blowholes into a fairy tale icescape of massive glaciers. But as a patrol of environmentalists approaches the Chilean super trawler in an inflatable boat, the cruder realities of modern industrial fishing come into view. From one of the ship’s drain holes, a steaming pink sludge cascades into the frigid waters of the Southern Ocean. It’s the foul-smelling runoff from processing the 80-meter (260-foot) factory ship’s valuable catch: Antarctic krill, a paper-clip-sized crustacean central to the region’sfoodweb and, scientists say, an important buffer to global warming. “What’s coming out of the side are the remnants of the ecosystem,” says Alistair Allan, an activist for Australia’s Bob Brown Foundation, as he looks on from the inflatable boat. “If this was off the coast of Alaska, it would be a national park. But since it’s down here at the bottom of the world, where no one is watching, you have ships almost running into whales feeding on the same things they’re fishing.” While krill fishing is banned in U.S. waters due to concerns it could impact whales, seals and other animals that feed on the shrimp-like creatures, it’s been taking place for decades inAntarctica, where krill are most abundant. It started in the 1960s, when the Soviet Union launched an industrial fleet of trawlers in search of an untapped protein source that could be canned like sardines. Surging demand for nutrient-rich krill — for feeding farm-raised fish, omega-3 pills, pet food and protein shakes — combined with advances in fishing and the still unknown impact from climate change has some scientists warning the fishery is at a critical juncture and in urgent need of stricter controls. But any further action is mired in geopolitical wrangling as Russia andChinalook to quickly expand the catch. Two Associated Press journalists spent more than two weeks at sea in March, at the tail end of the Southern Hemisphere’s summer, aboard the Dutch-flagged Allankay, operated by the conservation group Sea Shepherd Global, to take a rare, up-close look at the world’s southernmost fishery. It’s a harvest that by its very nature operates at the extremes — hundreds of miles from any port. ___ This story was supported by funding from the Walton Family Foundation. The AP is solely responsible for all content. ___ Starting every December, around 10 to 12 mostly Norwegian and Chinese vessels brave the rough seas whipping across the tip of South America to descend upon the South Orkney Islands, a desolate chain of rocky outcrops. From there, as temperatures warm, the fleet follows the massive swarms of krill toward the South Pole, fishing at the foundation of the fragile ecosystem’s food web. Under a conservation agreement developed almost two decades ago, the krill catch has soared: from 104,728 metric tons in 2007 to 415,508 metric tons in 2022, as larger, more sophisticated vessels have joined the chase. Those levels were below internationally agreed conservation limits. A U.S.-led coalition has been calling for more restrictions and marine reserves as krill’s vital role as food for other species and in removing large amounts of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere comes into focus. But it has met stiff opposition from China and Russia, which have made no secret of their geopolitical ambitions in the white continent. Direct competition with marine mammals seems inevitable — a reality dramatically underscored when four juvenile humpback whales were entangled by a Norwegian krill boat in 2021 and 2022. While the end of commercial whaling has allowed populations to rebound, a new study by the University of California, Santa Cruz found that pregnancy rates among humpback whales in Antarctica have been falling sharply — possibly due to a lack of krill, their main prey. Chinstrap penguins and fur seals face similar stresses. THE BOUNTY BELOW Jars of krill line the windowsills in Deborah Steinberg’s lab, their pink hue faded but their shells intact. Collected on a U.S. icebreaker, they fuel her research at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science. On a recent visit, a technician unscrews one of the jars, empties the formaldehyde and rinses the krill under running water, a dozen fitting in the palm of his hand. Tiny but bountiful, Antarctic krill make up one of the planet’s largest biomasses, nourishing everything from fish to marine mammals and seabirds. “All those iconic images we associate with Antarctica of whales, seals and penguins -- it’s a megafauna hotspot, and it’s because of krill,” Steinberg said. Lesser known is krill’s important role fighting climate change. Every year, krill remove as much as 23 megatons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, according to new research published by the World Wildlife Fund. That’s the equivalent of taking off the road 5 million cars every year. The carbon cleansing starts with phytoplankton that absorb greenhouse gases burned by humans, says Emma Cavan, a biologist at Imperial College London who co-authored the report. Krill feed on the microscopic plants and then transport fertilizing nutrients to the ocean floor in the form of waste and their molting shells. “Antarctic krill are worth more to nature and people left in the ocean than removed or lost through sea ice disappearance,” said Cavan, who recently submitted her estimates for peer review. Krill aren’t just a bulwark against climate change — they’re victims, too. At Steinberg’s lab, researchers are examining how warming oceans — Antarctic krill need water colder than 4 degrees Celsius (39 Fahrenheit) to survive — are altering krill’s life cycle. It’s a task made more urgent by a record loss in sea ice this year. Already, in the northernmost stretches of Antarctica where fishing activity is concentrated, populations have declined as krill migrate toward cooler waters closer to the South Pole, according to Steinberg. Other scientists say further research is required, questioning whether there’s evidence for a shift poleward and, if there is one, the cause of it. “There are surprises all the time,” Steinberg said. “And the fact that we are still learning about the effects of ocean warming on the population means we need to be very, very cautious.” REGULATING KRILL Much of the fight over krill is taking place thousands of miles away from the fishing grounds, in a former 19th century boarding school on the Australian island of Tasmania. It’s there, in the headquarters of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, or CCAMLR, that delegates from 27 member states are gathering this month to continue negotiations over a long overdue refresh of the krill management plan. The organization, established by treaty in 1982, has emerged as a model for science-based cooperation on the high seas — lawless waters that comprise nearly half the planet. But even some of the group’s boosters say it has failed to take into account the effects of climate change. “CCAMLR’s mandate is conservation — it’s right there in the name,” said Claire Christian, executive director of the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition, a Washington-based group that represents environmental organizations at CCAMLR proceedings. “It’s not to enable fishing.” One reason for the stalling is geopolitical wrangling. At the organization’s last annual meeting, Russia and China blocked a proposal by the U.S. that would restrict potentially dangerous unloading of krill at sea to cargo vessels. Moscow and Beijing are also pushing to expand fishing more quickly and in June teamed up to sink a proposal for a Texas-sized reserve along the Antarctic Peninsula, an area teeming with wildlife and tourists. The quarreling threatens to undermine conservation goals because all decisions must be unanimous. Currently, less than 5% of the Southern Ocean is protected — well behind CCAMLR’s target and not nearly enough to meet a United Nations goal to preserve 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030. But with quotas likely to increase under any new management system some see a silver lining in the deadlock. “The irony is that if certain members aren’t agreeing to the new framework, the catch limit won’t change,” said Dirk Welsford, an Australian government researcher who chairs CCAMLR’s scientific committee. “It would require a nation to go rogue.” CRUDE TO KRILL OIL The Antarctic Provider lords over the loading dock at the port of Montevideo, Uruguay, dwarfing semi-trucks and forklifts that race around the 168-meter (550-foot) cargo ship that gathers krill from vessels at sea. A crane springs from the ship’s hold dangling a dozen white sacks, each containing half a metric ton of Antarctic krill -- now labeled “Product of Norway.” This is the first stop on krill’s journey from remote wilderness to international commodity. From this South American hub, shipments of whole dried krill spread across the globe — to feed processors and salmon farms in Europe, Canada and Australia, pet food manufacturers in China and a former ice cream factory in Houston which produces 80% of the world’s krill oil. Dominating that supply chain is Aker BioMarine, a Norwegian company responsible for about 70% of the global krill catch by volume. It’s also driving innovation, having recently introduced continuous fishing with long, cylindrical nets attached to vacuums that have the capacity to suck up 1,200 metric tons of krill per day, although the company says its most advanced ship currently averages about 500 metric tons per day - the equivalent daily diet for about 150 humpback whales. The company touts its environmental stewardship. Among other initiatives, it funds marine research, supports the creation of marine reserves and says it has reduced its carbon emissions by 50% in the last decade. It also boasts the industry’s top eco-label for sustainability. But when it comes to fishing in Antarctica, emotions run high. “Some people believe we shouldn’t fish at all, we should all be vegetarians, we shouldn’t be in Antarctica,” CEO Matts Johansen said in an interview near Oslo, Norway, arguing that krill is a sustainable source of protein for a growing global population. “There is no single solution.” Johansen said fears of an explosion in fishing are misplaced as the industry isn’t even catching all that’s allowed. He sees consolidation, not growth, in the industry because of the huge investments required. “If you look at our numbers over the last 15 years, it’s not very good advertising,” Johansen said, noting that his company has been unprofitable. Aker BioMarine’s financial wherewithal depends on another, cruder type of oil: Norway’s massive natural gas and petroleum exports. Seafood is only 3% of the asset value of Aker BioMarine’s parent, an industrial conglomerate, Aker ASA, that includes Norway’s largest privately controlled energy company. But it’s a project dear to Aker BioMarine’s billionaire founder, Kjell Inge Røkke, who got his start in fishing in Alaska in the 1990s. The bulk of Aker BioMarine’s harvest ends up in tiny pellets used in fish pens around the world. In addition to speeding up growth, krill contains astaxanthin, a pigment that gives salmon a pinker color. “The fish love it,” said Brett Glencross, technical director of IFFO, a trade organization for the marine ingredients industry. “It’s like dipping your Brussels sprouts in chocolate to get kids to eat their vegetables.” Fish farming is big business — about half of the world’s seafood is now farm raised as the oceans have been emptied of wild-caught fish. Krill, while an expensive ingredient, can help ease rising pressure on wild fish stocks also used in aquaculture, like anchovies and sardines, said Jesse Trushenski, chief scientist at Boise, Idaho-based Riverence Farms, the U.S.’ largest trout producer. “It’s important to have all the options on the table,” said Trushenski, whose company does not use krill. “When I have an entire pantry to work with, there’s more flexibility.” KRILL OIL PILLS Beyond feeding seafood, Aker BioMarine’s big push is selling krill oil capsules, which were introduced in the early 2000s, amid growing interest in omega-3 fatty acid supplements and their purported role in promoting heart, brain and joint health. It describes its mission of placing pills on the shelves of drug stores around the world with almost evangelical fervor. “We’re in business to improve human and planetary health,” boasts a recent presentation for investors. But the jury is out on how effective they are. And omega-3 supplements — krill or otherwise — haven’t been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, according to the National Institutes of Health. Johansen says studies show krill oil contains health benefits not found in traditional fish oil, including fat molecules that Aker BioMarine says make it easier to deliver omega-3 to the brain, heart and liver. It also contains choline, an essential nutrient for regulating memory and mood. “Krill is packed with important nutrients so that we can stay healthy, live long and contribute to society,” said Johansen. William Harris, a professor at the University of South Dakota who helped invent a test that measures fatty acids in red blood cells, said he’s “agnostic” about where people get their omega-3. “Krill is fine. Fish oil is fine,” he said. In addition, he said many common foods, like eggs or mushrooms, are loaded in choline in orders of magnitude more than krill pills. Krill also typically contains lower levels of omega-3s than fish, so more must be harvested to have the same fat content, according to GOED, a Salt Lake City, Utah-based group representing the omega-3 industry. INDUSTRY CHANGES Criticism of the krill fishery’s management and environmental toll has spurred some reform. In the absence of more stringent regulation, the Association of Responsible Krill harvesting companies, whose members are responsible for 90% of the krill taken from Antarctica, adopted in 2018 a number of self-imposed restrictions. They include the creation of no-take zones near the Antarctic Peninsula that overlap with penguin breeding colonies. The group has also agreed with calls from groups including the Pew Bertarelli Ocean Legacy Project to come up with stricter rules on at-sea transfers of catch between vessels and the study of climate change on krill. Still, the group thinks quotas could be much higher. It points out that currently less than 1% of the estimated 60 million metric tons of krill found in the main Antarctic fishing grounds — an area larger than the U.S. — is being caught. That leaves the remaining 99% for whales and other animals. “If you look at those numbers, it’s clear we could fish more,” said Javier Arata, a Chilean trained biologist who heads the industry group. However, a leading marine biologist the industry once relied on to burnish its environmental credentials has since denounced krill fishing. Helena Herr, who studies whales at the University of Hamburg, was invited in 2021 by Arata's group to serve on an advisory panel. She accepted with the hope that she could help mitigate the effects of krill fishing on the Antarctic ecosystem. She resigned after a year, disgusted by what she viewed as the industry’s narrow focus on the buffer zones. “The more I learned about the voluntary commitment and its review process, the more I perceived the voluntary commitment as a ‘green-washing’ initiative,” she said in a resignation letter to her fellow panel members, a copy of which she provided the AP, using a term that refers to businesses making inaccurate claims that its actions are friendly to the environment. Today, she believes that krill fishing should be banned. “The buffer zones don’t decrease the overall fishing effort. They just relocate it,” she said in an interview. “People claim they know about biomass and the distribution of krill. But the data is based on such vague assumptions that we don’t really know what we’re doing.” Others have similar doubts. Whole Foods, the supermarket chain that prides itself on sustainable sourcing and is now owned by Amazon, pulled krill pills from its shelves in 2010 over concerns about the fishery’s environmental impact. And the World Wildlife Fund, which between 2007 and 2017 partnered with Aker BioMarine, lending its panda logo to promote the company’s products, has recently lodged concerns about the industry’s continued certification. Aker BioMarine in a promotional video says the amount of bycatch — unwanted fish and marine species other than krill — that it unintentionally nets on one of its ships in an entire year would fit into a “small bucket.” However, data it reported to CCAMLR put that the amount of annual bycatch — although small compared to other trawl fisheries — in the order of several metric tons per ship. When the AP pointed out this discrepancy to Johansen, he said that the claim appeared to be a mistake and the company would look into fixing its promotional material. “The key message that we’re trying to convey, and maybe it’s oversimplified in that picture of a bucket, is the bycatch in the krill fishery is extremely low,” he said. The stakes are high. In 2021, three juvenile humpback whales became entangled in a net used by Aker BioMarine’s Antarctic Sea within the span of two months. Following these incidents — the first whale deaths reported by a Norwegian krill ship — Aker BioMarine reinforced a rope barrier to repel large mammals. However, despite this modification, a fourth whale entanglement occurred on the same vessel the next season. In addition, every year, across the industry, dozens of seabirds collide with the trawlers’ metal cables, sometimes suffering deadly injuries. “The marine foragers are there for the same reason the boats are: because there’s lots of krill,” said Ari Friedlaender, a University of California, Santa Cruz biologist who has spent 25 years researching whales in Antarctica. “Some level of conflict is inevitable.” Friedlaender was among 17 authors of a recent study concluding that competition for krill and shrinking sea ice are threats to the reproductive rates of humpback whales. The peer-reviewed research, based on a measure of hormones in the blubber of female whales, found that pregnancies rise and fall sharply based on krill availability. The burning of dirty fossil fuels to fish in such remote waters also carries a heavy carbon footprint. Producing a single metric ton of krill emits an average 3,800 kilograms (8,400 pounds) of carbon dioxide, according to the Virginia-based Global Feed LCA Institute, an industry-led initiative that tracks the environmental costs of hundreds of feed ingredients. That’s more than six times the pollution associated with fishing for Peruvian anchovy, a popular ingredient for fish feed. Johansen downplayed such comparisons, saying Aker BioMarine’s own carbon footprint is much lower than the industry average and falling fast thanks to innovations in its engines. By 2050 it aims to eliminate the burning of fossil fuels altogether and power its fleet with hydrogen-based fuels currently in development. “We are going to be one of those first companies that use that,” he pledged. SUSTAINABILITY With an approaching storm threatening hurricane-force winds, the Allankay abandons the krill fleet and finds shelter in a quiet cove protected by the craggy rim of a still active underwater volcano. A stone’s throw from a few lounging sea lions, rusting storage tanks, boilers and beached harpoon boats lay testament to Deception Island’s past as a Norwegian whaling station. Here, between 1911 and 1931, were culled some of the 3 million whales killed last century as part of a mass slaughter that nearly drove them to extinction. A century later, its blanket of blubber no longer lighting up the world, whaling has all but ended and many once endangered species are thriving. Capt. Peter Hammarstedt, the campaign director for Sea Shepherd Global, sees an infinitely more complex threat hanging over the still recovering ecosystem – one as unassuming as krill-fed farmed salmon or health supplements on supermarket shelves. “Most people know sustainability when they see it,” says Hammarstedt, “and it does not look like a fleet of ships traveling thousands of miles, to the bottom of the world, to take out the very building block of life in the Antarctic ecosystem for products we simply do not need.” -- Keyton reported from off Antarctica and in Montevideo, Uruguay, and Ski, Norway; JoNel Aleccia in Los Angeles and Helen Wieffering and Fu Ting in Washington, D.C., contributed to this report. __ Contact AP’s global investigative team at Investigative@ap.org or https://www.ap.org/tips/    2\n",
              "India-US 2+2 ministerial dialogue: India to hold key defensive, strategic discussions with USA The US is likely to push India this week to take a more prominent role in deterring China in the region, a move that risks deepening tensions between New Delhi and Beijing. The US wants India to share some of its burden in the Indo-Pacific by increasing its diplomatic and military presence in the region, Indian officials aware of the details said, asking not to be named since discussions are private.  A bigger presence of the Indian Navy beyond Asian maritime choke-points and in to the tense South and East China Seas is also expected to be discussed, the people said. Defense Minister Rajnath Singh and External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar will meet their US counterparts Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III and Secretary of the State Antony  Blinken  on Nov. 10, in New Delhi. Blinken will also meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi at 4:35 p.m. local time.  It would be wrong to “prejudge” the conversations between the officials, Arindam Bagchi, the spokesperson for India’s Ministry External Affairs, told reporters at a briefing Thursday. The US Embassy in New Delhi didn’t respond to an email seeking comment. The US and India will, as part of the annual 2+2 dialogue, also review an initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies and are likely to discuss President Joe Biden’s proposed visit to India next year during the country’s Republic Day celebrations, Indian officials said. The White House hasn’t confirmed whether Biden will attend the annual military and cultural parade, held on Jan. 26, as India’s guest of honor. Barack Obama was the last US president to attend the ceremony in 2015.  The US request comes as it strengthens its alliances across Asia to deter what it sees as an increasingly assertive China, and tries to balance Beijing’s growing economic and military power. The US also faces the challenge of diplomatically and militarily supporting Ukraine and Israel in their respective battles against Russia and Hamas, which is considered a terrorist organization by the US and Europe.  Modi has moved India much closer to the US as Washington has courted New Delhi in recent years, amid hopes that the South Asian nation can grow into a regional counterweight to China. But India remains wary of being seen to be part of any informal alliance against China, fearing a ratcheting up of tensions along its disputed Himalayan border.  Border Clashes India and China share a 3,488 kilometer (2,167 miles) unmarked Himalayan border and are engaged in the worst confrontation between the two in four decades. Soldiers on both sides were killed in hand-to-hand combat in 2020 and the nuclear armed neighbors have since moved hundreds of tanks, missiles and fighter jets closer to the border.  While New Delhi moved swiftly to discourage investments from China and banned hundreds of Chinese mobile applications in the aftermath of that clash, it remains hesitant of overtly siding with the US against China. For example, India is a member of the revived Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, also known as the Quad, which also includes the US, Australia and Japan. But it prefers to highlight the economic and developmental aspect of the arrangement than the military role of the grouping, fearing Beijing’s ire. India has permanently deployed warships at five choke points in the Indian Ocean, stretching from the Gulf of Aden to the Lombok Strait in Indonesia. It has also sailed Indian naval vessels through the South China Sea in recent years.  However, it remains unclear whether the Indian Navy can take on the additional burden of a more steady presence in the areas the US would want help in. Its warships are at sea for as many as 300 days a year undertaking routine patrols, as it attempts to remain the dominant force in the Indian Ocean amid China’s quickly rising naval prowess. India is in the process of buying 31 high-altitude endurance drones from the US that will substantially add to its ability to maintain a closer watch over the region.

              "\"We don't want any foreign military boots on Maldivian soil… I promised this to the people of the Maldives and I will live up to my promise from day one.\" Dr Mohamed Muizzu, who won the Maldives presidential election last month, is wasting no time in asking India to get its troops out of the country.  The president-elect, who is due to be sworn in later in November, told the BBC in an exclusive interview that he met the Indian ambassador a few days after his victory and \"told him very clearly that every single Indian military personnel here should be removed\".  The Maldives has long been under India's sphere of influence and Mr Muizzu's demand is likely to trigger diplomatic tensions between Malé and Delhi. In fact, when Mr Muizzu won the Maldives presidential poll, that was seen as a setback for India - especially as his opponent, the incumbent Ibrahim Mohamed Solih - had drawn his country closer to Delhi since taking over in 2018. The alliance backing Mr Muizzu portrayed this relationship - strengthened by Mr Solih's India-first policy -  as a threat to the Maldives' sovereignty and security.  Mr Muizzu's alliance favours closer ties with China, which has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the Maldives in the form of loans and grants for infrastructure and development projects. But India, which wants a foothold in the strategically located islands to monitor a key part of the Indian Ocean, has also provided about $2bn in development assistance to the country.  If its troops are forced to leave, it will be a blow for Delhi. But a furore over \"gifts\" that Delhi gave the Maldives - two helicopters received in 2010 and 2013 and a small aircraft in 2020 - has given the \"India out\" campaign a huge boost. Delhi said the craft were to be used for search and rescue missions and medical evacuations.  But in 2021, the Maldivian defence force said about 75 Indian military personnel were based in the country to operate and maintain the Indian aircrafts. This fuelled suspicion and anger as many felt the reconnaissance aircraft were being used as an excuse to put Indian boots on the ground.   Mr Muizzu also says that the presence of these troops could put the Maldives at risk - especially as tensions between India and China escalate along their Himalayan border. \"Maldives is too small to get entangled with this global power struggle. We will not get entangled into this,\" he said. Speaking to the BBC before the presidential poll, the outgoing president Mr Solih said fears about the presence of Indian troops were exaggerated. \"There are no militarily active overseas personnel stationed in the Maldives. Indian personnel currently present in the country are under the operational command of the Maldives National Defence Force,\" he said. But it's not just the aircraft. Mr Muizzu said he wanted to review all the agreements the Maldives has signed with India in recent years.  \"We don't know what's in there. Even in Parliament, some of the MPs during the debates said that they didn't know what's in there. I am sure we will find it out,\" he said. Soon after his victory, observers noted that the Chinese ambassador in Malé was quick to congratulate Mr Muizzu. Chinese President Xi Jinping also weighed in, saying he attached \"great importance to the development of bilateral relations and stands ready to work with President-elect Muizzu to carry forward the traditional friendship, deepen practical cooperation\". Mr Muizzu has also spoken highly of Chinese infrastructure projects in the Maldives, saying the investments had transformed Malé city and brought benefits to its residents. However, he has denied being a \"pro-China\" candidate as opposed to the \"pro-India\" Mr Solih.  \"I am a pro-Maldives person. For me, Maldives comes first, our independence comes first\" he said. \"I am not pro or against any country.\" Despite this, however, his opposition alliance includes the party of former president Abdulla Yameen who was instrumental in moving the Maldives closer to China.  When India and Western lenders were not willing to offer loans to Yameen's administration due to allegations of human rights violations, Yameen - who is currently serving a 11-year prison sentence for corruption - turned to Beijing who offered him the money without any conditions. He then joined President Xi's Belt and Road Initiative - which aims to build road, rail and sea links between China and the rest of the world. Mr Muizzu was seen as a proxy of Yameen - who was barred from contesting the election.  Soon after he won the election Mr Muizzu asked the current administration to move Yameen from a high-security prison to house arrest in the capital Male.  But given Yameen's uneasy and tense relationship with Delhi, it could well be a struggle for Mr Muizzu's new alliance to balance ties with India.  Mr Muizzu sounds keen to emerge out of the shadows of Yameen and is all set to charter a new path both domestically and in the country's foreign affairs. Given his decisive victory he may not face much resistance internally, at least in the initial stages. He sounds determined to take the Maldives out of India's orbit but convincing Delhi to withdraw its troops may be his first big challenge.

              "AP Earthquakes that hit Nepal have an impact on the  Gangetic plains  because the soft soil of the region amplifies  seismic energy  originating from the  Himalayan  belt, seismologists said. On Friday night, a strong earthquake of magnitude 6.4 jolted Nepal sending waves of tremors across north India, including in Delhi-NCR. The National Centre for Seismology ( NCS ) had said the epicentre of the earthquake, which struck around 11.30 pm, was in Nepal, about 227 km north of Ayodhya in  Uttar Pradesh  and 331 km west northwest of Kathmandu.  It has claimed at least 143 lives and injured more than 150 in the Himalayan nation, and is the worst since 2015.  While seismologists warned that consecutive earthquakes are foretelling bigger seismic shocks in the western Nepal Himalayan region, an examination of the preliminary reports published by the NCS paint a geographical picture of the parts of India that experience these Nepal quakes and hence, are susceptible to them.  The centre issues such reports hours following an earthquake, detailing information about its epicentre and its depth, a preliminary analysis of the cause of the shocks, and the regions in India that felt the earthquake.  Its preliminary report on the November 3 seismic event said that it was widely felt in Delhi-NCR and neighbouring states. More than 90 \"felt reports\" were filed in from  Delhi , Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Haryana through the NCS' website and mobile app, the report said.  \"The earthquakes in this stretch of the Himalayas will have a distinct impact on the Gangetic Plains and population centres such as Delhi-NCR because the soft soil of this region amplifies the seismic energy originating from the Himalayan region,\" CP Rajendran, Adjunct Professor, National Institute of Advanced Studies, Bangalore, said.  About the regions likely to be affected by future major earthquakes, \"Indus-Gangetic-Brahmaputra Plains - from Jammu in the northwest all the way to upper Assam in the northeast - are all vulnerable,\" said Supriyo Mitra, Professor, Department of Earth Sciences, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Kolkata.  On the earthquake that hit Nepal on October 22, the NCS' report said that it was felt in Bihar. The epicentre of the seismic shocks (magnitude 5.3) was 72 km northwest of Kathmandu and at a shallow depth of 10 km, it said.  The seismic events in Nepal on October 3 were felt in Delhi, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan and Punjab. \"More than 70 felt reports had been registered in the hour following the strongest shock of magnitude-6.2, which had its epicentre 302 km east of Haridwar and 206 km southeast of Joshimath, and at a shallow depth of five km,\" the centre's report said.  Tremors were felt in Chandigarh, Jaipur and other parts of north India as well. Experience Your Economic Times Newspaper, The Digital Way!

              "KATHMANDU, Nepal --A gay couple inNepalon Wednesday became the first in the nation to receive official same-sex marriage status. The Himalayan nation is one of the first in Asia to allow it. “After 23 years of struggle we got this historic achievement, and finally Maya and Surendra got their marriage registered at the local administration office,” said Sunil Babu Pant, an openly gay former parliamentarian and leadingLGBTQ+ rights activist. Pant was present with Surendra Pandey and Maya Gurung when they registered their marriage at the Dorje village council office, located in the mountains west of the capital, Kathmandu. Earlier this year, Nepal's supreme court issued an interim order enabling the registration of same-sex marriages for the first time. Officials had initially refused to register the marriage. The couple and Pant filed cases with the Kathmandu District Court and High Court, but their pleas were rejected. According to Pant, the Home Ministry this week made changes in the process enabling all local administration offices to register same-sex marriages. “It was quite unexpected and it was a positive breeze for us,” Pant said by phone from the village where the couple were expected to celebrate later Wednesday. The couple married six years ago at a temple following Hindu tradition, with a priest conducting the rituals among friends and family. But they had no certificate showing their marriage was legal. Nepal has undergone a transformation since a court decision in 2007 asked the government to make changes in favor of LGBTQ+ people. People who do not identify as female or male are now able to choose “third gender” on their passports and other government documents. The constitution adopted in 2015 also explicitly states there can be no discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.
